It’s only a dream without a plan. Working back from your long term goal what do you need to achieve/do over the next few years. Don’t go too granular on the dates as things will change as the future is uncertain.

## <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tasks/Objectives</span>

What are the tasks/objectives that I need to perform in order to achieve my short, medium and long term goals? 

* What work could I focus on in the current tasks that will help me achieve those long term goals? 
* What areas should I find opportunities for so I can develop the skills and experience for the long term goals? 

After I have completed a task/objective what was good about that task/objective? Did I achieve the experience, practice, skill I expected to? What would I do differently next time? Would I choose a different goal/intended outcome/focus on something different?
